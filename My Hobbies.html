    My Hope:
I hope to become a skilled and confident Full Stack Developer. My goal is to master both front-end and back-end technologies so I can build complete, responsive, and dynamic web applications. I am passionate about solving problems through code and creating digital solutions that make a difference. Becoming a full stack developer will allow me to work on all layers of a project, from designing user interfaces to building powerful server-side logic. I look forward to continuously learning, improving my skills, and contributing to real-world projects in the tech industry.
